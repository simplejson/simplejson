simplejson is a simple, fast, complete, correct and extensible
JSON <http://json.org> encoder and decoder for Python 2.5+
and Python 3.3+.  It is pure Python code with no dependencies,
but includes an optional C extension for a serious speed boost.

The latest documentation for simplejson can be read online here:
http://simplejson.readthedocs.org/

simplejson is the externally maintained development version of the
json library included with Python 2.6 and Python 3.0, but maintains
backwards compatibility with Python 2.5.

The encoder may be subclassed to provide serialization in any kind of
situation, without any special support by the objects to be serialized
(somewhat like pickle).

The decoder can handle incoming JSON strings of any specified encoding
(UTF-8 by default).
